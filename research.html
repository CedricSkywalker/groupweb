										<h2>Second Harmonic Generation</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="row gtr-200">
										<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
											<p>Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear optical process in which two photons with the same frequency interact with a nonlinear medium simultaneously to generate a new photon with twice the frequency of the initial photons. Because of the symmetry requirement for the second order nonlinear processes, the leading dipolar term of the SHG processes is generally forbidden for the centrosymmetric bulk medium, and thus SHG is a inherently effective probe for the surface of the centrosymmetric bulk phase. Especially in the situation of liquid surface while many of other powerful electronic   methods like STM, XPS, et al are unavailable. Thorough this nonlinear optical technique, being spectroscopic, we can quantitatively get the knowledge about orientational structure, the energetics that drive chemical and physical processes, and the time scale of molecular motions and relaxation processes of the molecules at the interface at the most fundamental level. SHG has been developed for nearly 40 years from the first application of SHG in surface studies by Shen & coworkers. The second harmonic generation (SHG), has been proven not only interface selective but also chiral sensitive. In general, there are three kinds of experiments to study chiral using the SHG techniques. Two of them use linearly polarized light, including SHG linear dichroism (SHG-LD) and SHG optical rotation dispersion (SHG-ORD), and the third uses the circularly polarized light, including the SHG circular dichroism (SHG-CD) surfaces. This nonlinear chiroptical method has been demonstrated to be an ideal in situ technique to probe the supramolecular chirality of the Langmuir monolayer at the air/water interface. </p>

										<h2>Multimodal Nonlinear Spectroscopy Platform</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="row gtr-200">
										<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
											<p>This instrumental platform is based on the synchronized femtosecond short pulse and picosecond long pulse laser amplifier systems, which was first used by the principle investigator to realize
												the sub-wavenumber high resolution broadband sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, and using the same physical principle and with the same laser system
												platform to further develop and extend to other related nonlinear vibrational and electronic spectroscopy techniques, including sub-wavenumber high-resolution
												broadband sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy, anti-Stokes coherent Raman spectroscopy, nonlinear
												infrared absorption spectroscopy, visible-visible single resonance sum-frequency generation electronic spectroscopy, and doubly-resonant visible-infrared and
												infrared-visible sum-frequency generation vibrational and electronic spectroscopy, etc. This multimodal nonlinear spectroscopy platform will provide systematic and
												unique research methods and tools for molecular structure and interaction dynamics of condensed phase, surface and interface related to the broad scientific problems
												in chemistry, material, energy, environment and biological sciences. </p>
